*Image source: Image created with the Runway ML text-to-image generative model, using a prompt that requested several Brazilian flags in the shape of the cloud computing icon, rendered in an artistic style. The cloud computing icon is an integral element of the field of Digital Methods, as it represents infrastructure, platforms, and services that power web-based applications that support data processing, storage, and analysis, and enable the development of web-based research software. Brazilian multiple tiny flags speak of the country's diversity and perspectives, including in advancing ways of doing digital methods.*

This roundtable fosters dialogue about the current state of digital methods for Internet research in Brazil. We seek to celebrate emerging research practices and kick off a Global South.
