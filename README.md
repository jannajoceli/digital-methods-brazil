*Image source: Image created with the Runway ML text-to-image generative model, using a prompt that requested several Brazilian flags in the shape of the cloud computing icon, rendered in an artistic style. The cloud computing icon is an integral element of the field of Digital Methods, as it represents infrastructure, platforms, and services that power web-based applications that support data processing, storage, and analysis, and enable the development of web-based research software. Brazilian multiple tiny flags speak of the country's diversity and perspectives, including in advancing ways of doing digital methods.*

This roundtable fosters dialogue about the current state of digital methods for Internet research in Brazil. We seek to celebrate emerging research practices and kick off a Global South.
## Call for Participation
This roundtable fosters dialogue about the current state of digital methods for Internet research in Brazil. We seek to celebrate emerging research practices and kick off a Global South network, situating them within a transitional methodological moment in which digital methods and methodologies have been built with, in and about AI, web platforms and data visualisation. This roundtable does not provide an exhaustive overview of digital methods in Brazil. Instead, it focuses on approaches specifically developed within the Brazilian context, offering unique perspectives on the field. 🇧🇷
