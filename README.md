## Call for Participation
This roundtable fosters dialogue about the current state of digital methods for Internet research in Brazil. We seek to celebrate emerging research practices and kick off a Global South network, situating them within a transitional methodological moment in which digital methods and methodologies have been built with, in and about AI, web platforms and data visualisation. This roundtable does not provide an exhaustive overview of digital methods in Brazil. Instead, it focuses on approaches specifically developed within the Brazilian context, offering unique perspectives on the field. üáßüá∑

### What Digital Methods are we talking about?
The digital methods we discuss are known as a means to repurpose the functioning of dominant web platforms, search engines and online data for social research. Also, considering the technicity of AI and computational medium, these methods invite researchers to (re) think and create new ways of designing and implementing research methods. Digital Methods have been used to advance social media research, media and OSINT studies, and digital investigation.

Digital methods are crucially situated in the technological environments they utilise and build on: the web environments, data, technologies and practices, and software for data curation, analysis and visualisation. In this sense, designing and implementing digital methods integrates i) the technical aspects of web environments, technologies, objects, and AI but also respects ii) online (sub) cultures of use while iii) actively and critically engaging with capturing, analysis and visualisation software in their own language. These pillars not only inform, (re)shape and add new layers of meaning to the object of study but also form the epistemological foundation of knowledge central to digital methods. 

### A hybrid round-table at King‚Äôs College London
This hybrid round table will discuss the current status of digital methods research in Brazil and what one can understand as ‚Äúmethods‚Äù when advancing research with the web as a methodological landscape. Rather than defining an exhaustive landscape of the practice, it aims to open up discussions about the role of digital methods in humanities and social sciences and their broad societal impact from a Brazilian perspective. What are the emerging creative methods developed in Brazil that leverage the web, its technologies and data to address research questions starting online/offline? Which digital methods are being implemented, and what for? What are their relevance and broader implications for studying digital media and culture in the country? Who is developing digital methods and research software? How are Brazil‚Äôs gender and race-diverse perspectives advancing the field? 

In this celebrative encounter, panellists will discuss: a mapping of initiatives and labs across five Brazilian regions within this context, the convergences and possibilities of connecting digital methods with traditional (Digital) Media and Communication Studies schools, and the history of software development for digital methods research in Brazil and its challenges.

### A quick-and-dirty Historical Context of Digital Methods in Brazil
‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler Alert: This is a simplified and brief overview rather than a comprehensive introduction to digital methods and their historical context in Brazil. 


In early 2011, three women started the first steps of digital methods in Brazil with the book [‚ÄúM√©todos de Pesquisa para Internet‚Äù (2011)](https://www.editorasulina.com.br/detalhes.php?id=530), published by Sulina in Porto Alegre, Brazilian South Region. Suely Fragoso, Raquel Recuero and Adriana Amaral introduce methodological approaches that account for the Internet as an object of research (the subject being studied), a research environment (the setting where research is conducted) and a research instrument (e.g., a tool for data collection on a specific topic). Examples are network visualisation using online data, hyperlinks and ethnographic analysis for internet studies. In 2012, Fernanda Bruno founded the [MediaLab.UFRJ](https://medialabufrj.net/sobre/) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazilian Southeast Region. Based in the School of Communication, the lab focuses on techno-politics, subjectivities, and visibilities, using digital methods for data analysis and visualisation in the humanities. 
In 2013, in the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù era of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram APIs, research labs such as [Labic](https://www.labic.net/) in Espirito Santo advanced digital methods for social media research to monitor and study the [2013 protests in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_protests_in_Brazil), also known as June Journeys. This series of nationwide demonstrations claimed to stop corruption and improve public services, among other grievances. The lab, constituted by a multidisciplinary team of coordinators, has significantly contributed to the growth of digital methods in Brazil by showing the impact and relevance of repurposing web data and technologies in a societal context. The book ‚ÄúA Comunica√ß√£o das Coisas: Teoria Ator-Rede e Cibercultura‚Äù (2013) by Andr√© Lemos became an early influence on the methodological thinking that emphasises the agency of media and their mediations in shaping digital phenomena. Lemos‚Äô research lab [LAB404](https://lab404.ufba.br/lab404/) (founded in 2006) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Brazilian Northeast Region, and work, drawing from Science and Technology Studies (STS), while being characterised by a conceptual framework, his advocacy for addressing the technical affordances of media in communication studies laid foundational groundwork aligned with the principles of digital methods and their development in Brazil.
In 2016, the data journalism [Coda.BR](https://escoladedados.org/coda/coda2016/) event in S√£o Paulo emerged to provide training for journalists, researchers, and data enthusiasts in Brazil, and it later became known as the Brazilian Conference on Data Journalism and Digital Methods. Everton Zanella Alvarenga, then-executive director of Open Knowledge Brazil, and journalists Nat√°lia Mazotte and Marco T√∫lio Pires, were instrumental in implementing the project in Brazil. In the same year, the Brazilian Institute of Research and Data Analysis (IBPAD) and the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) played pivotal roles in advancing digital methods in Brazil. The former is by offering courses and publications covering techniques for monitoring and researching social media. The latter is through the Department of Public Policy Analysis (DAPP Lab), which developed methodologies to meet academic needs and produced reports to serve the public through multidisciplinary research. In 2017, the [Advanced Studies Center on Digital Democracy (CEADD)](https://inctdd.org/democracia-digital-no-brasil/) of UFBA became the central laboratory of the National Institute of Science and Technology for Digital Democracy (INCT.DD). This initiative has focused on understanding how media and networks shape political and social phenomena, such as the rise of the far-right, misinformation, and electoral campaigns. 

In 2019, M√©todos Digitais: Teoria-Pr√°tica-Cr√≠tica (2019), edited by Janna Joceli Omena, marks the launch of the first book in Portuguese on digital methods, gathering seminal and original texts authored by key Brazilians and International researchers in the field. The book addresses digital methods from a theoretical, practical, and critical perspective and has been adopted by several Brazilian universities to introduce these methods. Since 2019, research groups and labs have been established in the country, including the principles and practice of digital methods. For instance, the [R-EST research group](http://www.dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/498637) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), under Carlos D'Andrea's coordination, investigates how digital platforms mediate political and social interactions.

## Programme
Opening 14:00 - 14:15
Welcome & What digital methods are we talking about?
Janna Joceli Omena (in person)
This opening statement unpacks digital methods from conceptual and practical perspectives. It will focus on how the practice of digital methods enables researchers to conduct digital fieldwork and gain a deeper understanding of their study topic through the lens of three distinct yet interconnected pillars: (i) platform grammatisation, (ii) online (sub)cultures of use, and (iii) the affordances and limitations of computational media necessary for implementing the method.
